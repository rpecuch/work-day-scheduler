## Description

The purpose of this application is to allow users to create and save events that will be occurring during the workday. This provides a visual representation of the day ahead and helps workers quickly find open time blocks for additional events. While building this application, I became comfortable with incorporating jQuery syntax, Bootstrap class naming conventions, and Moment.js methods into web applications.

## Usage

To access this application, visit the following URL: [https://rpecuch.github.io/work-day-scheduler/](https://rpecuch.github.io/work-day-scheduler/). The calendar blocks are color-coded based on the time of day: grey represents events that have already occurred, red represents events that are currently happening, and green represents events that are in the future.

To add an event, click on any colored block, type the name of the event, and click on the icon to add the event.

When the application is refreshed, all saved events will remain on the calendar.
