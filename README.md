# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this application is to allow users to create and save events that will be occurring during the workday into a calendar. This provides a visual representation of the work day and helps workers quickly find open time blocks for additional events. While building this application, I became comfortable with incorporating jQuery syntax, Bootstrap class naming conventions, and Moment.js methods into web applications.
